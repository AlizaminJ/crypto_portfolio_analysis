# crypto_portfolio_analysis
A Jupyter notebook that helps me get a better viewpoint into my crypto portfolio.

## Setup
To be able to run the notebook, you'll need to first install the python packages listed in requirements.txt. I suggest doing so in a virtual environment.

```
virtualenv -p python3 env
source env/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You need to create a tradesheet which should include your FIAT deposits, FIAT withdrawls, and crypto trades as they occurred in your portfolio. An example is included called tradesheet.csv.

## Run
```
jupyter notebook
```
